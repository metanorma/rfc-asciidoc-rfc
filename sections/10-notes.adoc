== Notes And Asides

Asciidoctor supports a range of "admonitions", including notes, warnings, and
tips. They are indicated by a paragraph prefix (e.g. `WARNING:`), or as a block
with an admonition style attribute. All admonitions are converted to `note` elements in the document preamble, and `cref` documents in the main document.
RFC XML v3 also supports asides (Asciidoctor sidebars):

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Section 1
[NOTE,source=GBS]
.Note Title
====
Any admonition inside the body of the text is a comment.
====

****
Sidebar

Another sidebar

* This is a list

....
And this is ascii-art
....
****
----

[source,xml]
----
<section anchor="_section_1" numbered="false">
  <name>Section 1</name>
  <t>
    <cref display="true" source="GBS">
      Any admonition inside the body of the text is a comment.
    </cref>
  </t>
  <aside>
    <t>Sidebar</t>
    <t>Another sidebar</t>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a list</li>
    </ul>
    <figure>
      <artwork type="ascii-art">
        And this is ascii-art
      </artwork>
    </figure>
  </aside>
----

Note that no inline formatting is permitted in RFC XML v2, and it is stripped
for v2 by the converter.

Because paragraphs in Asciidoctor cannot contain any other blocks, a comment at
the end of a paragraph is treated as a new block. In the document converter,
any such comments are moved inside the preceding RFC XML paragraph; if the
comment is at the start of a section, as in the example above, it is wrapped
inside a paragraph.

While Asciidoctor has comments proper, notated with initial `//`, they are
ignore by the document converter, so they will not appear as XML comments in
the converter output.
