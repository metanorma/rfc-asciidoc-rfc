== Blockquotes

Asciidoctor supports blockquotes and quotations of verse; its block quotations
permit arbitrary levels of quote nesting. RFC XML v3, and thus AsciiRFC, only supports one level of
blockquotes. Unlike RFC XML v2, RFC XML v3 does not support line breaks outside of tables; so
verse quotations are converted to prose in the v3 converter.

Help! Help! I'm being repressed!

King Arthur: Bloody peasant!

Dennis: Oh, what a giveaway!
* Did you hear that?
* Did you hear that, eh?
* That's what I'm on about!
** Did you see him repressing me?
