== Blockquotes

Asciidoctor syntax supports blockquotes and quotations of verse; its
block quotations permit arbitrary levels of quote nesting.  RFC XML
v3, and thus AsciiRFC, only supports one level of blockquotes.

Unlike RFC XML v2, RFC XML v3 does not support line breaks outside of
tables, so verse quotations are converted to prose in the v3
converter.

An example of using AsciiRFC Blockquotes is given in
<<source-asciirfc-blockquotes>> with its rendered version in
<<source-asciirfc-blockquotes-v3>>.
