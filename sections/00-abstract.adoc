== Abstract

This document describes an AsciiDoc language extension, called asciidoctor-rfc,
whose syntax is specifically designed for writing IETF Internet-Drafts and
RFCs.

The asciidoctor-rfc syntax is designed to allow the author to entirely focus
on text, providing the full power of the resulting XML RFC through the AsciiDoc
language, while abstracting away the need to manually edit XML, including for
references.

This document itself was written and generated into XML RFC v2 <<RFC7749>> and
XML RFC v3 <<RFC7991>> directly through asciidoctor-rfc.
