== Introduction

This document describes a markup language called "AsciiRFC", developed
specifically for the purpose of generating RFC XML document, based on
Asciidoctor syntax.  AsciiRFC can be used to generate compliant RFC
XML v2 and v3 documents through the usage of an open source, MIT-licensed
Ruby gem called "asciidoctor-rfc" written by the authors

// This is from another part of the document
References to a normative reference are inserted with the macro
`cite:norm[id]` instead of pass:a[`<<id>>`], where `id` is the anchor
of the reference.
