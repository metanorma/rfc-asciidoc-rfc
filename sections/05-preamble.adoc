optionally be tagged with the `abstract` style attribute. Any notes in the

= A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers

:abbrev: IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers
:status: informational
:name: internet-draft-avian-transmission-00

Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether
space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
IEEE802.3.

The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network
technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in
some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.
