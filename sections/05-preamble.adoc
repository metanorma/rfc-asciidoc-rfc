= Four Yorkshiremen Sketch

The "Four Yorkshiremen" sketch is a comedy sketch written by 
Tim Brooke-Taylor, John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman and 
originally performed on their TV series _At Last the 1948 Show_ in 1967. 
It later became associated with the comedy group Monty Python 
(which included Cleese and Chapman), who performed it in their live 
shows, including _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl_. 

The sketch is a parody of nostalgic conversations about humble 
beginnings or difficult childhoods, featuring four men from Yorkshire 
who reminisce about their upbringing. As the conversation progresses 
they try to outdo one another, and their accounts of deprived 
childhoods become increasingly absurd. 

NOTE:  Barry Cryer is the wine waiter in the original performance 
and may have contributed to the writing.

The original performance of the sketch by the four creators is one of 
the surviving sketches from the programme and can be seen on the 
_At Last the 1948 Show_ DVD.
