[#preamble]
== Preamble

The preamble in AsciiRFC is the text between the end of the document header
(which terminates with a blank line) and the first section of text.

Any paragraphs of text in the preamble are treated as an abstract, and may
optionally be tagged with the `abstract` style attribute.

Any notes in the preamble are treated as a `note` element.

An example of setting the preamble is given in
<<source-asciirfc-preamble>> with its rendering in
<<source-asciirfc-preamble-v3>>.
