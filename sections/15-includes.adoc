== Inclusions

The http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-directive[Asciidoctor "include" directive]
is used to include external files in a master Asciidoctor document. The
directive is capable of sophisticated document merging, including adjusting the
heading levels of the included text, selecting text within specified tags or
line numbers to be included, and adjusting the indentation of code snippets in
merged text:

[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::path[
  leveloffset=_offset_,
  lines=_ranges_,
  tag(s)=_name(s)_,
  indent=_depth_
]
