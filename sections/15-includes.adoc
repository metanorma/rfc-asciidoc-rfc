== Inclusions

The http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-directive[Asciidoctor "include" directive]
is used to include external files in a master Asciidoctor document. The
directive is capable of sophisticated document merging, including adjusting the
heading levels of the included text, selecting text within specified tags or
line numbers to be included, and adjusting the indentation of code snippets in
merged text:

[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::path[
  leveloffset=_offset_,
  lines=_ranges_,
  tag(s)=_name(s)_,
  indent=_depth_
]
----

If a file is included in an Asciidoc document, ensure it ends with a blank line.
An inclusion that results in its final block not being delimited with a blank line
from what follows can lead to unpredictable results.
