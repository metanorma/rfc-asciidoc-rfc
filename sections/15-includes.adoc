== Inclusions

AsciiRFC inherits the Asciidoctor syntax "include" directive
<<Asciidoctor-Manual>> to include external files in a master AsciiRFC
document. 

This directive is capable of sophisticated document merging, including
adjusting the heading levels of the included text, selecting text
within specified tags or line numbers to be included, and adjusting
the indentation of code snippets in merged text.

Its basic syntax is given in <<source-asciirfc-include>>.

If a file is included in an AsciiRFC document, ensure it ends with a
blank line.  An inclusion that results in its final block not being
delimited with a blank line from what follows can lead to
unpredictable results.
