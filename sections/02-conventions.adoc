=== Definitions

In this document, _AsciiDoc_ refers to the markup language generically.
_Asciidoctor_ refers specifically to the Ruby-based implementation of
the markup language, which has enhanced the original markup language.
The RFC XML document converter contributed by the authors uses a subset of
_Asciidoctor_, with some minor additions (a few document attributes
specific to RFC XML, some macros specific to citation processing,
and some templated use of _Asciidoctor_ crossreferences). This variant
of _Asciidoctor_ markup is referred to as _AsciiRFC_.
