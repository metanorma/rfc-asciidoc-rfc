== Security Considerations

* Ensure your AsciiRFC generator comes from a geniune and trustworthy source.
This protects your own machine and also prevents injection of malicious content
in your document.

* An AsciiRFC generator may cause errors in textual rendering or link generation
that may lead to security issues.

* Creating cross-references (and also bibliographic references) to external
documents may pose risks since the external document's location may become
controlled by a malicious party.
