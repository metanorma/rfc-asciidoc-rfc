=== Basic Lists

AsciiRFC supports ordered, unordered, and definition lists.
Indentation of ordered and unordered lists is indicated by repeating
the list item prefix (`*` and `.` respectively); for definition
lists, it is indicated by incrementing the number of definition term delimiters
(`::`).

List attributes can be used to specify the type of symbol used for
ordered lists.

An example of an unordered list is shown in
<<source-asciirfc-unordered-list>> (with its rendered version in
<<source-asciirfc-unordered-list-v3>>). An example of an ordered list 
with ordered and unordered sublists is
shown in <<source-asciirfc-ordered-list>> (with its rendered version
in <<source-asciirfc-ordered-list-v3>>). An example of a definition
list is shown in <<source-asciirfc-definition-list>> (with its
rendered version in <<source-asciirfc-definition-list-v3>>).

=== List Continuation

A list item by default spans a single paragraph. A following paragraph
or other block element can be appended to the current list item by
prefixing it with `+` in a separate line.

See the "List Continuation" section in <<Asciidoctor-Manual>> for more
information.

An example of list continuation with text is shown in
<<source-asciirfc-list-text>> with its rendered version in
<<source-asciirfc-list-text-v3>>.

(Multiple paragraphs are not permitted within a list item in RFC XML
v2.  The RFC XML converter deals with this by converting paragraph
breaks into line breaks within a list item.)

List continuations can also be embedded to populate a list item with a
sequence of blocks as a unit (in an Asciidoctor syntax open block).

An example of list continuation with a delimited block is shown in
<<source-asciirfc-list-block>> with its rendered version in
<<source-asciirfc-list-block-v3>>.

AsciiDoc, and thus AsciiRFC, considers paragraphs to be the basic
level of blocks, and does not permit lists to be nested within them:
any text after a list is considered to be a new paragraph.

Therefore, markup as shown in <<source-asciirfc-list-impossible>>
cannot be generated via AsciiRFC.
