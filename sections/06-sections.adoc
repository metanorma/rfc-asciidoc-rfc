== Sections and Paragraphs

Section headers are given with a sequence of `=`, where the number of 
instances of `=` gives the header level.
The document itself opens with a single `=`, and sections within it
must be started with a minimum of `==`.  

Section numbering is toggled with the
in-document attribute `:sectnums:` (on), `:sectnums!:` (off). The boolean
`toc` attribute can also be set on sections, indicating whether the
section can be included in the document's table of contents.

<<source-asciirfc-sections>> shows how sections and paragraphs are
used in AsciiRFC, and its rendered form is shown in
<<source-asciirfc-sections-v3>>.

Note that skipped sections, such as defining a section using `====`
within a section defined using `==`, is not allowed in AsciiRFC
syntax. Doing so will trigger an error with the following message:

[source,console]
