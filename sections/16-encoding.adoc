=== Encoding and Entities

XML accepted the full range of characters in the world's languages through
UTF-8 character encoding, and one of the motivations for the move from plain
text to RFC XML has been to allow non-ASCII characters to be included in RFCs.
However, current RFC XML v2 tools still do not support UTF-8, and other tool
support for UTF-8 also remains patchy. Out of an abundance of caution, the RFC
XML converter uses US-ASCII for its character encoding, and renders any
non-ASCII characters as entities.

The converter accepts HTML entities in Asciidoctor, even though they are not
part of the XML specification; HTML entities such as `&nbsp;` feature in
examples of RFC XML provided by the IETF. In order to prevent dependence of the
XML output from extraneous entity definitions, any such entities are rendered
in the XML as decimal character entities.
