[abstract]
The Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog is a fictional character in the Monty
Python film _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_. The scene in _Holy Grail_
was written by Graham Chapman and John Cleese. The rabbit is the
antagonist in a major set piece battle, and makes a similar appearance
in _Spamalot_, a musical inspired by the movie.

== Terminology
In this document, the key words *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *REQUIRED*,
*SHALL*, *SHALL NOT*, *SHOULD*, *SHOULD NOT*, *RECOMMENDED*, *MAY*, and
*OPTIONAL* are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <<RFC2119>>.

== In The Film

The Cave of Caerbannog (_caer bannog_ being Welsh for "turreted castle",
thus making its title a pun on the English dish "Welsh rabbit") is the
home of the Legendary Black Beast of Arrrghhh (named for the last
utterance of anyone who ever saw it). This is guarded by a monster
which is initially unknown. King Arthur and his knights are led to the
cave by Tim the Enchanter and find that they must face its guardian
beast.

=== Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch

The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch is a visual satire of the Sovereign's
Orb of the United Kingdom, and may refer to the mythical Holy Spear of
Antioch. The Holy Hand Grenade is described as one of the
"sacred relics" carried by Brother Maynard. Despite its ornate
appearance and long-winded instructions, it functions much the same
as any other hand grenade.

== Cultural Impact

The rabbit is now used as a metaphor for something ostensibly harmless
which is, in fact, deadly. Such hidden but real risks may even arise
from similarly cuddly animals.

The Cave of Caerbannog (_caer bannog_ being Welsh for "turreted
castle", thus making its title a pun on the English dish "Welsh
rabbit") is the home of the Legendary Black Beast of Arrrghhh
(((Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog)))
(named for the last utterance of anyone who ever saw it). This is
guarded by a monster which is initially unknown. ((King Arthur)) and
his knights are led to the cave by ((Tim the Enchanter)) and find that
they must face its guardian beast.

****
The rabbit scene was shot outside the Tomnadashan mine, a cave 4 miles
(6.5 km) from the Perthshire village of Killin. For the 25th
anniversary DVD, Michael Palin and Terry Jones returned to be
interviewed in front of the cave but they could not remember the
location.
****

* Tim verbally paints a picture of
a terrible monster with "nasty, big, pointy teeth!", so terrifying
that Sir Robin soils his armour at the mere description.
(((Sir Robin, soiling armour)))
* When the
guardian appears to be an innocuous white rabbit
(<<killer_bunny,See depiction>>:
http://ascii.co.uk/art/rabbit[RABBIT - ASCII ART]), surrounded
by the bones of the fallen, Arthur and his knights no longer take it
seriously.
** Ignoring Tim's warnings ("a vicious streak a mile wide!"),
King Arthur
orders Bors to chop its head off.
[upperalpha,group=Victims]
... Bors confidently approaches it,
sword drawn, and is immediately decapitated by the rabbit biting
clean through his neck, to the sound of a can opener.
** Despite their
initial shock, Sir Robin soiling his armor again, and Tim's loud
scoffing, the knights attack in force.
[upperalpha,group=Victims]
... But the rabbit injures several
of the knights and kills Gawain and Ector with ease. The knights
themselves have no hope of killing or injuring the rabbit.
** Arthur
panics and shouts for the knights to retreat ("Run away!").
* Knowing
they cannot risk attacking again, they try to find another way to
defeat the beast.
* The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch is ultimately
used to kill it and allow the quest to proceed.

.Tip for the Bridge scene
What is Lancelot's favourite colour? Will come in handy later.

The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch is a visual satire of the Sovereign's
Orb of the United Kingdom, Figure <<sovereign_orb,format=counter>>,
and may refer to the mythical Holy Spear of Antioch. The Holy Hand
Grenade is described as one of the "sacred relics" carried by Brother
Maynard. Despite its ornate appearance and long-winded instructions,
it functions much the same as any other hand grenade. At King Arthur's
prompting, instructions for its use are read aloud from the fictitious
_Book of Armaments_, Chapter 2, verses 9-21.

NOTE: Verses parodying the King James Bible and the Athanasian Creed.

[keep-with-previous=true]
[quote,Book of Armaments 2:9-21,
  https://genius.com/Monty-python-holy-hand-grenade-of-antioch-lyrics]
And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,
"O *LORD*, bless this Thy hand grenade that with it Thou
[bcp14]#mayest# blow Thine enemies to tiny bits, in Thy mercy." And
the *LORD* did grin and
the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies
and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats and large chu...
[At this point, the friar is urged by ((Brother Maynard)) to
"skip a bit, brother"]... And the *LORD* spake, saying, "First
[bcp14]#shalt# thou take out the Holy Pin, then [bcp14]#shalt# thou
count to three, no more, no less. Three
[bcp14]#shall# be the number thou [bcp14]#shalt# count, and the number
of the counting [bcp14]#shall# be three. Four [bcp14]#shalt# thou not
count, neither count thou two,
excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once
the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest
thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who being
naughty in My sight, [bcp14]#shall# snuff it."

        <t>The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch is a visual satire of the
          Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom, Figure
          <xref format="counter" target="sovereign_orb" />, and may
          refer to the mythical Holy Spear of Antioch. The Holy Hand
          Grenade is described as one of the "sacred relics" carried
          by Brother Maynard. Despite its ornate appearance and
          long-winded instructions, it functions much the same as any
          other hand grenade. At King Arthur's prompting, instructions
          for its use are read aloud from the fictitious
          <em>Book of Armaments</em>, Chapter 2, verses 9-21.

          Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,

          with it Thou <bcp14>MAYEST</bcp14> blow Thine enemies to
          tiny bits,
          in Thy mercy." And the <strong>LORD</strong> did grin and
          the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and
          anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and fruit
          bats and large

          thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou
          then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once
